## Folder Structure

When a receptionist or cahier starts the application, first it should ask appropriate menu to choose patient age. Then when cashier enters the age, another menu displays to display or choose the service level. When cashier enters the service level the amount payable should be auto calculated by knowing whether the customer have Medicare/private insurance. If yes, then the discount/cover applied then only the gap will be collected from customer. If no, then customer/patient needs to pay the full amount. The same will be repeated for many customers by cashier., so the program will loop repeatedly until the user says so.  
 
At the end of each day, the application should be display total amount of service that has been offered today.  


> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
